## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you have found a security problem with *django-s3-cache* **DO NOT** report
it into GitHub Issues. Instead go to

At least one of the package maintainers ([@atodorov](http://github.com/atodorov))
is a lifter at Tidelift and will be notified when you report the security
problem with them!
